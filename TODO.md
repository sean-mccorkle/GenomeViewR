* abstract out segment compilation so that both plots and coverage histograms use it

* filter on matched pairs

* tracks

* program to read.table() genes gff3 file once, and then save as a binary
  so the binary can be hopfully quickly loaded.

* Coverage histograms

    * coverage
    
        try R based first
        
    * hist plot

    * associated vertical scale

* Include all genes in window

* Faster retrieval from SAM files

    x indexing SAM files?

    * when reading SAM blocks, if pos is too close to edge, read two blocks.

    * BAM file support?
